**Incorporated:**  2012 Jul 2

**Founders:**  Brian Armstrong, Fred Ehrsam

                          Fred Ehrsam                                    Brian Armstrong
          
**Inception:**  In 2010, Co-Founder Brian Armstrong read the manifesto published by Satoshi Nakamoto, that proposed bitcoin as an underground currency.  In which transactions are recorded on a ledger called Blockchain, maintained in duplicated computer files by a band of self-appointed guardians called nodes.  For this reason, Armstrong saw an opportunity in the business of safeguarding the keys to the coins and setting up transactions. Thus leading to the development of Coinbase a simple way for people to buy and sell Bitcoins using bank transfers. 

**Funded & Amount Funded:**  

Coinbase brokers exchanges various crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin. Thus allowing users to invest by scheduling buys daily, weekly or monthly, while also securely storing their assets, and insurance. Essentially, Coinbase charges a ‘Coinbase Fee’ on all transactions, which is the greater of either a flat rate or a percentage rate depending on location and payment type.  The flat fee only applies to amounts less than $200 to account for the costs of processing. In most cases, Coinbase’s rate of 1.49% per transaction will apply (3.99% for credit and debit cards). Furthermore, there is approximately 0.5% spread that Coinbase places on the current market rate for any cryptocurrency, and the size of this spread can fluctuate depending on current market circumstances.  Meaning that any purchase of a cryptocurrency will be at a 0.5% higher price than the actual market price at the time of the transaction, and 0.5% lower in the case of a sale.

In the early stages, Coinbase was grouped in a class of start-ups being incubated at Y Combinator. In fact, Amstrong initially raised $164,000 before Fred Wilson a venture capitalist from Union Square Ventures invested $5 million into Coinbase. Subsequently, this lead to funding from the following companies over the past 8 years:

**Companies Funded & Transaction Value, Month & Year:**

 * May 2013 - Uninion Square Ventures - $5 Million

 * Dec 2013 - Andreessen Horowitz - $25 Million

 * Jan 2015 - DFJ Growth - $75 Million 

 * Jul 2016 - Bank Of Tokyo - Mitsubishi UFJ - $10.5 Million

 * Aug 2017 - IVP (Institutional Venture Partners) - $108.1 Million

 * Oct 2018 - Tiger Global Management - $300 Million

 * Dec 2018 - Fundamental Labs, True Capital, Chainfund Capital - $22 Million

## Business Activities

**Coinbase Issues:** Historically, Coinbase has on multiple occasions withdrew unauthorized money from user accounts.  Resulting in negative balances and significant overdraft fees.  According to a statement released by an Coinbase employee, he claimed the issues were a result of a change in the way credit cards classify digital currency transactions. In addition, a second Coinbase employee revealed that “the unexpected charges are originating outside of our control, and are related to charges from previous purchases.” 

**Intended Customers:** Coinbase appeals to consumers are those who are tech savvy and seek more privacy. A recent survey conducted by the Global Blockchain Council and SurveyMonkey that was taken by 5,000 Americans found that 60 percent of Americans have heard of bitcoin and that around five percent hold the digital currency. Estimated based on the entire U.S. population, that would result in 16 million Americans have invested in bitcoin. In addition the results showed that Bitcoin investors have a pretty well-defined profile. And that 71% are male, 58% are a millennial—between 18-34 years old, They trust Bitcoin 7% more than they trust the U.S. government, and If given $1000, they’re roughly 3 times more likely to invest it in Bitcoin than put it into their savings account.

## Recommendations

Advice:  Coinbase is too costly. The fees and spreads charged for fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-crypto transactions are amongst the highest in the industry.   

Coinbase has limited Cryptocurrencies and Trading Features. Despite Coinbase efforts to provide access to most major coins, the lack of access to less than popular coins limits the amount of availability provided by the company. Furthermore, the unsufficient amount of advanced analytical tools leads to online traders relying to outside tools to perform trading strategies. 

Benefits:  Security.  Coinbase’s security features range from mandatory 2-step verification to institutional industry best practices to cold storage of 98% of digital assets to insurance for both digital and fiat assets. All these security features add up to make Coinbase as safe as is possible when it comes to protecting your assets.

Utilization:  Blockchain Messenger

Technology Solution:  Blockhain Messaenger would allow people to create and join active private chats, groups, and discussions amongst the crypto-currency community. This would serve to facilitate information and transaction exchange between traders whom are looking to discuss and exchange cryptocurrencies.
